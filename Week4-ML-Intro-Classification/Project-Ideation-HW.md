# Project Ideation
Over the course of this semester, you will be working in groups of 2 to develop a Data Science project that you will demo at the end of the semester on Demo Night.

To help us form groups, I would like each of you to __pick out 3 datasets that interest you and come up with an idea for a project__.  This will help you form groups by finding common interests. (Once you have formed teams, you will discuss, choose, and refine your proposals further. Each team will develop a single data science project.) 

If you do not have your own idea, it is okay to do a Kaggle competition or piggyback on another data science project that has already been done.  

__There are two main types of projects, a data visualization type and a model / classifier type.__

Some examples of last years projects are:
1. (Data Visualization Type) NYC Police Complaint Database: [https://nypdcomplaintsnavigator.herokuapp.com/](https://nypdcomplaintsnavigator.herokuapp.com/)
2. (Model/Classifier Type) NFL Game Predictor: [https://nfl-oracle.herokuapp.com/](https://nfl-oracle.herokuapp.com/)

__***Next week we will all review all the slides together, so make sure you fill one out by next week.***__
